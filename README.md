## üìú Overview
This mini drone was designed for **fun, learning, and experimentation** in micro UAV building.  
The goal was to create a **lightweight, affordable** drone using easy-to-source components, with an **Arduino Nano** as the flight controller and an **NRF24L01+** module for wireless control.

**Flight Controller:** Arduino Nano  
**Motors:** 615 Coreless (37,000 RPM)  
**Props:** 31mm, 4-blade  
**Battery:** 2 √ó 3.7V 380mAh LiPo in series  
**Frame:** 3D-printed PLA

## ‚ú® Features
- Compact, **lightweight micro quadcopter**
- 2.4GHz NRF24L01 wireless control
- **PID tuning** for stable flight
- Fully open-source firmware & hardware files
- Modular design for easy repairs and upgrades
