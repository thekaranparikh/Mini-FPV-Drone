# Mini-FPV-Drone
This mini drone was designed for **fun, learning, and experimentation** in micro UAV building.   The goal was to create a **lightweight, affordable** drone using easy-to-source components, with an **Arduino Nano** as the flight controller and an **NRF24L01+** module for wireless control.
